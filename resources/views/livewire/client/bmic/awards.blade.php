                                The BMI Annual Report of 2014 won a “Compliance Certificate” in the 51st Annual Report Awards 2015 conducted by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka. This is the first ever certificate received for a BMI Annual Report and was granted in recognition of the cohesive, clear and customized reporting, especially in compliance reports, under the “Not-for-profit organization including NGO” category. While this gives a clear identification of the current standard of stakeholder reporting at BMI, the organization intends to keep on improving the standard of reporting every year.
