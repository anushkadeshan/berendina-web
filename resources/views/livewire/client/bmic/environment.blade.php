    <p class="text-justify mt-20" style="text-align: justify;">37 biogas units were built by BMIC worth of LKR 5.79
        million including finance and technical changes. The contribution was divided as below,
    <ul class="list-icon theme-colored" style="font-size: 4px;">
        <li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i>Beneficiary finance and physical contribution (35%) was LKR 2.03 million

        <li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i>BMIC finance and technical contribution (35%) was LKR 2.03 million and</li>
        <li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i>Donor finance contribution (30%) was LKR 1.64 million from Stromme Micro
            Credit Guarantee Limited (SMCGL) and
            UNDP Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA) programme.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Project objectives were adaptation of Renewable Energy (RE) technology to combat global warming and increase
    profitability for families by reducing fuel and electricity cost in household. In addition, slurry generated
    through biogas digester is a good organic fertilizer which can be used for not only on home gardening but for
    the commercial agriculture activities as well. The project facilitated such market transformation of Renewable
    Energy technologies and other co-benefits by introducing bio gas digesters to clients.

    <p class="text-justify mt-20" style="text-align: justify;">
        Most micro enterprises in this trade are lacking the technical knowledge and financial strength to construct
        wastewater treatment unit for their service stations. BMIC identified these reasons and provided support in the
        form of financial contribution and technical knowhow to construct 13 wastewater treatment units worth of LKR 2.1
        million. Grant funding was received from Stromme Micro Credit Guarantee Limited (SMCGL) in addition to BMIC &

    <h5 class="line-bottom mt-20"><b>Health & Safety Program </b></h5>
    <p class="text-justify mt-20" style="text-align: justify;">
        BMIC BMIC identifies enterprises which may harm to the people due to non-adherence of proper occupational health
        and safety measures.

        awareness sessions.
        
        One of the traditional industries of Sri Lanka with a long history is making iron and wrought iron tools. Many
        rural villagers engage in this industry as their main livelihood activity. People in Kottalbadda in Anuradhapura
        are famed for their specialized skills in iron and metal works and have been engaged in this industry for many
        generations.

        <br><br>


        Due to the high prices in purchasing protective gears and no proper knowledge on how to use them every day, most
        of the blacksmiths ignore wearing them and take a great deal of risk in their day-to-day work environment. This
        attitude creates safety issues as well as health complications in a longer run.
        <br><br>
        To mitigate this prolonged issue, Berendina organized a Health and Safety Awareness Program at Ipalogama Branch
        for 15 micro credit clients attached to the BMIC branch who are into iron work industry. The objective of the
        session was to enhance their knowledge and importance of taking safety precautions and wearing safety gears.

    <h5 class="line-bottom mt-20"><b>Waste Paper Recycling Program to reduce Ecological Foot Print on Paper Usage</b>
    </h5>
    <p class="text-justify mt-20" style="text-align: justify;">
        it is a notable fact that most companies use paper for all documentation purposes which can lead to adverse
        impacts if not managed in a sustainable manner. Understanding this fact, BMIC promotes “paper to paper” concept
        instead of “tree to paper” concept by launching a wastepaper recycling program at Head Office in collaboration
        with Neptune Recyclers (Pvt) Limited a local recycling company to reduce the ecological foot print of paper
        usage at the working environment. Staffs are advised to minimize the use of paper and encouraged for electronic
        documentation methodology.
