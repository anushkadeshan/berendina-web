                As an organization, we leveraged towards distributing the necessary financial aid and emergency
                deliveries to hard hit areas of the society whose lives and livelihoods have been threatened by the
                pandemic, including supporting the authorities and health sector by distributing essential medical
                equipment and other items required.

            Packs of dry rations and other items were distributed to the care homes and quarantined families. Dry rations contained essential staples such as rice, milk powder and sugar, etc, including sanitary products, medicine and supplementary products such as Panadol, Isocal and Diabetasol. The objective of the relief assistance was to maintain acceptable levels of nutrition and hygiene conditions of most vulnerable families.
