                As an organization, we leveraged towards distributing the necessary financial aid and emergency
                deliveries to hard hit areas of the society whose lives and livelihoods have been threatened by the
                pandemic, including supporting the authorities and health sector by distributing essential medical
                equipment and other items required.

                <br>
                Most of our focus was directed towards the equipping Intermediate Care Centers with required necessary
                medical equipment such as oxygen therapy equipment which includes oxygen concentrators, oxygen cylinders
                and connectors, Pulse Oximeters, Multipara monitors, PPE etc. and other items required for the critical
                functioning of the Intermediate Care Centers.

                Packs of dry rations and other items were distributed to the care homes and quarantined families. It
                contained staples such as rice, sugar, milk powder and sugar, etc, including sanitary products, medicine
                and supplementary products such as Panadol, Isocal and Diabetasol. As well as personal hygiene products
                such as toothpaste, toothbrushes and soap. The objective of the relief assistance was to improve the
                daily food consumption of households that were most vulnerable and to maintain acceptable levels of
                nutrition and hygiene conditions

                As part of our Bright Student Scholarship stipend, we granted students with an allowance to assist with
                their required online learning to purchase data, as schools were closed due to the pandemic.
