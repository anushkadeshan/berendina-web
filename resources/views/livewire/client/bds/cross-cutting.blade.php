The majority of the people with disabilities are poor. Poverty is a consequence of disability since people with disabilities often lack access to education, health services and income-generating activities. They are often denied their human, social and economic rights which contribute to high levels of vulnerability and exclusion. People with disabilities have the right to work. This has been enshrined in several national Acts and international Conventions ratified by the government of Sri Lanka, but policy implementation measures are still inadequate to enable them to exercise that right. BDS ensures that the all development initiatives taken by the organization would provide reasonable space for the participation of persons with disabilities.')
