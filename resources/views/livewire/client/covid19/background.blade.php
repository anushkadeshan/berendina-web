        As an organization, in 2020 we leveraged our resources towards
        distributing the necessary financial aid and emergency support to hard
        hit areas of the society whose lives and livelihoods have been
        threatened by the pandemic, including supporting the authorities and
        health sector by distributing essential medical equipment and other
        items required. <br />
        <br />

        In 2021, our focus was directed towards the equipping Intermediate Care
        Centers with required necessary medical equipment such as oxygen therapy
        equipment which includes oxygen concentrators, oxygen cylinders and
        connectors, Pulse Oximeters, Multipara monitors, PPE etc. and other
        items required for the critical functioning of the Intermediate Care
        Centers. <br />
        <br />

        Packs of dry rations and other items were distributed to the care homes
        and quarantined families. Dry rations contained essential staples such
        as rice, milk powder and sugar, etc, including sanitary products,
        medicine and supplementary products such as Panadol, Isocal and
        Diabetasol. The objective of the relief assistance was to maintain
        acceptable levels of nutrition and hygiene conditions of most vulnerable
        families.<br />

        As part of our Bright Student Scholarship program, we granted students
        with an additional allowance to purchase data packages in order to
        ensure continuation of their education through online platforms during
        the time of school closure due to the pandemic.
